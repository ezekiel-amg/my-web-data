               <h1>Testimonials</h1>
              <p>“I just wanted to share a quick note and let you know that you guys do a really good job. I’m glad I decided to work with you. It’s really great how easy your websites are to update and manage. I never have any problem at all.

My new site is so much faster and easier to work with than my old site. It used to take me an hour or more to update a page and I would still sometimes screw things up.

Now it’s almost like having a designer right here with me. I just choose the page, make the change and click save. It’s so simple.

Thanks, guys!”</p> <br>

<p>A good testimonial is direct
Put the most impactful statement at the beginning. Edit it so even if people read just the first few words, they get the meaning quickly. Here’s that same example, made shorter and without the extra words at the beginning…

“You made it so simple. My new site is so much faster and easier to work with than my old site. I just choose the page, make the change and click save. Thanks, guys!”</p> <br>

<p>“Wow. I just updated my site and it was SO SIMPLE. I am blown away. You guys truly kick ass. Thanks for being so awesome. High fives!”</p> <br>

<p>"Its pleasure  working with Ezeteck and we look forward to working with him again. He’s definitely the kind of designer you can trust with a project from start to finish.”</p>
